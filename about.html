    <h3>WINE</h3>
    <p>When it comes to wine, it’s worth describing it all: sight, scents, textures and flavors. Here are a few descriptions you can use:</p>
    <p>1. The color - Wine has often more than one color. Mention the primary color and the secondary colors: Ruby red with purple hues, golden with green tones, and pale straw with hints of silver.</p>
    <p>2. The wine’s concentration - Mention the depth of color in red wine: Deep, rich, concentrated, opaque.</p>
    <p>3. The intensity of aromas - some wines are very expressive, and you should mention that. Intense, expressive, ‘fills the room with…’.</p>
    <p>4. The fruit aromas - For reds, see if you can find: blackberries, raspberries, currants, cranberries or blueberries. For whites, use: apples, pears, limes, lemons, grapefruit, guava, lychee or mango.</p>
   
    <br>

    <h3>Food</h3>
    <p>For food, it’s best to describe the central element in the dish and then mention the sauces and sides.</p>
    <p>1. Mention the cooking method - Steamed, char-grilled, pan-fried, stir-fried, or slow-cooked.</p>
    <p>2. Soft textures - smooth, silky, unctuous, coating, tender, and juicy.</p>
    <p>3. Other textures - charred, crispy, firm, crunchy, and ‘al dente.’ </p>
    <p>4. What makes a dish unique - mention if this is a ‘house special,’ a ‘best seller’ or a ‘family recipe’.</p>

      <p>Hello guys. I am Maria. Honestly speaking, first i looked into the website thinking that charges would be very high comparing that of hotels. But, this website surprised me a lot. Because the charges are very cheap and nothing to say about the taste. Anyone who cares for their health, along with wants to eat restaurant food, can surely opt this  </p>

      <p>HEY, Myself Raman Suresh, I am crazy at fast foods, but too lazy to go and buy from hotels. my parents always warn me that such type of restaurant foods are too bad. But this website seems to be a solution to this. It, along with providing taste food items, gives no comprimise for quality. I refer this to anyone seeing this webpage </p>

      <h2>Alian</h2>
      <h4>21/aug/2021</h4>
      <p>HI ,I am Alian. To say, there is nothing to say about the quality and taste of these foods. all of them are to be given high rating, but the one that gained my impression the most is the customer and delivery service. the delivery boy is an outstanding guy and seems to be well behaving. i gave this startup witha rating of 4.5/5. </p>
